# Notion governance staging (manual copy source)

**Status:** Operational  
**Purpose:** Canonical snippets for manual reconciliation of Hedgr Notion surfaces (Decision Log, Strategy & Insights, or equivalent executive views).  
**Authority:** The repository is source of truth. Wording here must match `docs/decisions/0016-warmth-layer-doctrine-constrained-retail-refinement-track.md`, `docs/decisions/SPRINT-2-ADR-INDEX.md`, and `docs/ops/HEDGR_STATUS.md`. Do not broaden scope, imply acceptance beyond **Proposed**, or soften read-only / non-execution boundaries in Notion.

**Last reconciled:** 2026-04-02 (ADR 0016)

## 1. Decision Log — ADR 0016 (copy row)

Use one row per field below (or map to your Notion schema equivalents).

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Decision ID / ADR** | ADR 0016 |
| **Title** | Warmth Layer as a doctrine-constrained retail refinement track during the read-only Stability Engine phase |
| **Status** | Proposed |
| **Decision Type** | UX/Trust |
| **Strategic Horizon** | Short-term (MVP / immediate sprint) |
| **Visibility** | Internal |
| **Date** | 2026-04-02 |
| **Repo file** | `docs/decisions/0016-warmth-layer-doctrine-constrained-retail-refinement-track.md` |

Notion Decision Log ID: D-016 ↔ Repo ADR: 0016

**Summary / notes (concise)**

- Allows a **parallel** Warmth Layer refinement track (presentation: layout, typography, microcopy, discoverability—per ADR 0016 and `SPRINT-2-ADR-INDEX.md`).
- Refines **presentation**, not product truth.
- Does **not** alter the read-only Stability Engine posture.
- Does **not** authorize execution semantics, accounting truth, hidden reallocation, ledger duplication, yield-first framing, or gamified stability language. (Same boundaries as ADR 0016 **Warmth Layer may not** and `HEDGR_STATUS.md` §2.)

## 2. Strategy & Insights / Executive Dashboard — Warmth Layer (copy block)

Use as a governed workstream line, **not** as a shipped-feature claim. Placement should stay **subordinate** to Stability Engine core posture (read-only, informational, non-executing).

**Short line**

- **Warmth Layer (ADR 0016, Proposed):** Parallel, doctrine-constrained **presentation** refinement only; does not change read-only Stability Engine posture. Must not introduce execution semantics, accounting truth, hidden reallocation, ledger duplication, yield-first framing, or gamified stability language. See ADR 0016 and `docs/ops/HEDGR_STATUS.md` §2.

**Supporting repo pointers (do not paraphrase into strategy)**

- `docs/decisions/0016-warmth-layer-doctrine-constrained-retail-refinement-track.md`
- `docs/decisions/SPRINT-2-ADR-INDEX.md` (ADR 0016 section)
- `docs/ops/HEDGR_STATUS.md` §2, §3

---

## 3. Field definitions

Decision Log field names follow `docs/doctrine/hedgrops-decision-governance-and-adr-export-standard.md` §4 (Canonical Decision Structure).

---

## 4. Repo gaps (operational)

- There is **no** automated Notion sync in this repository; reconciliation is **manual** from this file and the cited paths above.
- **Visibility: Internal** — per governance standard, Internal decisions are not auto-exported as public ADRs; repo ADR 0016 exists for institutional traceability and remains the detailed record.
